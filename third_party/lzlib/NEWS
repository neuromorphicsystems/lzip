Changes in version 1.13:

The variables AR and ARFLAGS can now be set from configure. (Before you
needed to run 'make AR=<ar_command>'. (Reported by Hoël Bézier).

In case of error in a numerical argument to a command line option, minilzip
now shows the name of the option and the range of valid values.

'minilzip --check-lib' now checks that LZ_API_VERSION and LZ_version_string
match.

Several descriptions have been improved in manual, '--help', and man page.

The texinfo category of the manual has been changed from 'Data Compression'
to 'Compression' to match that of gzip. (Reported by Alfred M. Szmidt).
